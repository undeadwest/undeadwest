i watch movies that involved wars, victorian-ww1/2 themed, metal/goths/etc. Yes, i talk politically sometimes. just LMK if you're uncomfortable with it. 

i have strict dni, i block/ignore freely if i found you exhausting or annoying. 

(my arts nor ocs is not political. I just simply enjoyed drawing them as war soldiers, if you catch my drift).
